# TimeTracker
I found myself tracking my hours in a notepad document which was messy, time consuming and difficult to update and see how long I have currently worked. Since COVID-19 I have been working purely from home. I track and log my own hours, this assists me of managing how long I spent and I can enter my expected end time to see how many hours it would be.

This project was created for me to better manage and track the time I spend working and on break. A feature exists to deduct time spent on break, it is currently from the first break to the last break.

I intend to eventually add a feature which only compares every other break, when it started and when you got back.
